Module 10 challenge
The first part of the assignment was completed with some challenges.  I used a lot of the course examples along with assistance from the TAs, instructor and ChatGPT.
The most challenging part was the app.py file. I could not get it to open the relative path to the file.  The instructor and TA assisted me on fixing that issue.  Then after completing the first api.route on percipitation, I thought it would be smooth saily.  However I ran into a serious Programming Error.  After spending time with AskBCS, I was instructed to open and close a session for each route.  So you will see tht reflected in the code.  I had to inquire about how to do that in which I discovered that I had to use try: and finally: with it.
After all of the struggles, I believe I am turning in an acceptable completed assignment, with the routes
